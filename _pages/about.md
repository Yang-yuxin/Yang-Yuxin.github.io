Hello, this is Yuxin Yang!

About me
======
I am a first year Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Viktor Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). My research interests lie in representation learning on graphs and temporal graphs. Subtopics include acclerating and scaling existing algorithms, exploring more effective learning paradigms, etc. I am also exploring the effective solution of leveraging the ability of Large Language Models to benefit graph learning tasks.

Before joining USC, I got my B.S. degree from Department of Automation in Tsinghua University. I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io/), [Prof. Yitao Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KVzR1XEAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Yilin Mo](https://yilinmo.github.io/) in my undergraduate years.

Other interests
======
In my spare time, I enjoy music, piano, and multiple sports activities. I am actively learning music theory (built an interactive [webpage on harmony chords](https://yang-yuxin.github.io/easychord/)). 
I am finding cycling and running routes throughout Los Angeles.
